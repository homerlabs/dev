It takes about 55 seconds with a Terminal Prime of 10,000,000 and about 17 minutes for a Terminal Prime of 100,000,000.</p><p>Click on the 'Find Primes' button and Prime Finder will create a file (deleting any current file at that path) and start appending primes to it one line at a time.</p><h2>Creating the NicePrime File</h2><p>Click on the 'Find NPrimes' button and Prime Finder will create a file (deleting any current file at that path) and start appending nice primes to it one line at a time.  It does this by reading the Prime file line  by line.  First, subtract 1 and then divide by 2 (as the value is now even).  The resulting value is tested if it's prime.  If it is, then the original prime is a nice prime and gets appended to the NicePrime file.</p></body></html>
