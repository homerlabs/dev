Using rows for an example, this algorithm checks on each row for an occurrence of a value being found in only one cell.  If such cells are found then those cells are considered Solved at this point.</p><p>The before and after screenshots below show this applied to rows:</p><p><img src="images/alg1Before.png" width="600" height="700"></p><p>Notice on row 1 that the vlaue '7' only appears once.  Therefore it is that cell where the '7' must be placed.  Same thing for row 2, value '9' and for row 5, value '7'.</p><p>When this algorithm is applied to this particular puzzle in column mode, no such cells are found.</p><p><img src="images/alg1After.png" width="600" height="700"></p><a href="./index.htm">Main Page</a></body></html>
