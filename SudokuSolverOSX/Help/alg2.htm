This algorithm is by far the most powerful of the 3 methods.  As it scans a row, column, or block it looks for a set of cells of size N that are all a subset of some set of size N.</p><p>The before and after screenshots below show this applied to rows:</p><p><img src="images/alg2Before.png" width="600" height="700"></p><p>Notice row 1 cells 5 and 6 have the value '9' removed and column 9 has the values '2' and '9' removed.  This is because the algorithm found the set {29} with one value in column 1 and the other in column 7.  While the algorithm can't tell which value goes in which cell, it does know that one value must go in cell 1 and the other value must be in cell 7.  Therefore those 2 values cannot reside in any other of the cells for that row.  If the algorithm is run again it will find the new set {36} on row 1 which will produce a solution value of '1' for cell 9.</p><p>In row 5 column 7 the values '2' and '5' have been removed.  This is because the set {125} was found in columns 2, 3, and 8.  Note:  in this case the {125} set was found in these 3 sets: {125}, {25}, and {12}.  A much harder {125} set to find would be this set: {12}, {15}, and {25}.  This algorithm will find the {125} set in both cases.</p><p>Rows 4 and 8 column 7 got reduced because in the same column row 5 a solution '6' was found.  During the post algorithm prunning process this '6' was removed from all rows for that column except the solution row 5.</p><p><img src="images/alg2After.png" width="600" height="700"></p><a href="./index.htm">Main Page</a></body></html>
