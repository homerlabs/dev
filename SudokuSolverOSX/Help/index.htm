This will determine N where N = P * Q and Phi where Phi = (P-1) * (Q-1).</p><p>Finally, choose a prime (less than Phi) for the Public Key after which the Private Key is calculated using the Extended Euclid Algorithm.</p><p>At this point the RSA Engine is setup and ready to Encode and Decode text files.  Now create a small plaintext.txt file using only characters from the character set.  If any characters are found which are not contained in the Character Set, they will be replaced with the first character in the Character Set.</p><h2>Setting up Plaintext and Ciphertext filepaths for an Encode operation</h2><p>The simplest way to setup filepaths is to click on the Encode button.  If the Plaintext path has not been already set, you will see an OpenPanel dialog where you can select the plaintext file to be encrypted.  Likewise, if the Ciphertext path has not been set, you will see a SavePanel dialog where you can specify the path and filename of the Ciphertext file.  These paths are saved and bookmarked for future Encode operations.</p><h2>Setting up Ciphertext and DeCiphertext filepaths for a Decode operation</h2><p>The simplest way to setup filepaths is to click on the Decode button.  If the Ciphertext path has not been already set, you will see an OpenPanel dialog where you can select the ciphertext file to be decrypted.  Likewise, if the DeCiphertext path has not been set, you will see a SavePanel dialog where you can specify the path and filename of the DeCiphertext file.  These paths are saved and bookmarked for future Decode operations.</p><h2>How HLCrypto processes input files using the functions: Chunker, ChunkToInt, and IntToChunk</h2><p>The input file is 'chunked up' where the chunk size is C = log(N)/log(S) where S is the Character Set Size plus one.  Each chunk is then converted to an Integer between 1 and N.  This Integer is then converted (Encoded or Decoded).  The converted Integer is then converted back to a chunk of characters.  Each converted chunk is then appended to an output file.</p></body></html>
