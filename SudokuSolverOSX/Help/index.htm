When the unsolved node count reaches 0 the puzzle is solved and the Solve button is disabled as no more solving can take place.</p><p>The puzzle is solved by repeated application of the three algorithms available through the Algorithm Selection bar just under the puzzle cell array.  The following pages describe in detail how the algorithms work.</p><a href="alg1.htm">Algorithm 1:  Mono Cell</a><br><a href="alg2.htm">Algorithm 2:  Find Sets</a><br><a href="alg3.htm">Algorithm 3:  Mono Sector</a><br><p>Written by Matthew Homer<br>HomerLabs<br>San Jose, CA<br>Last Modified: 12/19/2018</p></body></html>
