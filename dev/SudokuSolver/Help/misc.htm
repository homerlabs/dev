When the unsolved node count reaches 0 the puzzle is solved and the Solve button becomes disabled.</p><p>The puzzle is solved by repeated application of the three algorithms available through the Algorithm Selection bar just under the puzzle cell array.</p><h2>All 3 Algorithms Perform Calculations on Rows</h2><p>To perform an operation on a Column, the 9x9 matrix is transposed, the operation is performed, and then the matrix is transposed back.  To perfrom an operation on a Block, the Block is mapped to a Row, the operation is performed, then the results are remapped back to a Block.</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Written by Matthew Homer<br>HomerLabs<br>San Jose, CA<br>Last Modified: 5/19/2020</p><h3>Special thanks to "www.websudoku.com"</h3><a href="./index.htm">Main Page</a></body></html>
