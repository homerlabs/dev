Without any knowledge of adjacent cells the possible solutions for the 'Unsolved' cells are {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} otherwise known as 'the full set'.  By 'pruning' however, many degrees of freedom can be eliminated.  For any given cell, pruning can be applied to the Row, Column, and Block that the cell is located in.  Pruning should be applied to all cells for all 3 modes (Rows, Columns, and Blocks) after initial puzzle import.  Aso, after every 'Solve' operation the data set is pruned post Solve operation.  Specifically, any time any cell becomes 'Solved', the data set should be pruned.</p><p>As an example take the screenshot below.  A typical puzzle just after being imported.  This is the starting point and typical of what you see after tapping the 'New Puzzle' button.</p><span class="img-container"> <!-- Inline parent element --><img src="images/pruneBefore.png" width="417" height="556"></span><p>Below is the puzzle after pruning.  Rows and Columns are counted 1 through 9.  Cell(9,6) was reduced to the point of being solved.  Values 2, 7, 8 and 9 can be removed from this cell as they are solved values within its Row.  Values 1 and 6 can be removed as they are solved values within its Column.  And values 3 and 4 can be removed as they are values within its Block.</p><p>Because this pruning operation caused one or more cells to become 'Solved', the data set was pruned again.  This caused Cell(9,5) to become Solved and after another round of pruning Cell(9,1) becomes solved.</p><span class="img-container"> <!-- Inline parent element --><img src="images/pruneAfter.png" width="417" height="556"></span><h1>Solve</h1><p>After the puzzle has been imported and pruned, the Prune button becomes the Solve button.  By repeated application of all 3 solve algorithms the puzzle will eventually reach zero Unsolved Nodes.  At this time the puzzle has become solved and the Solve button becomes disabled.</p><h1>Undo</h1><p>A copy of the previous data set is maintained.  If the Undo button is tapped this previous data set is copied to the current data set.  Nested Undos are not permitted so after each Undo operation the Undo button becomes disabled.  It becomes re-enabled after the next Solve operation.</p><a href="./index.htm">Main Page</a></body></html>
