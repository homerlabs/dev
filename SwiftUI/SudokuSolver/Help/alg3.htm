It compares the data in the row (or column) with data shared with a block.  A row sector contains 3 consecutive columns that reside within the same block and a column sector contains 3 consecutive rows that reside with the same block.  For example, rows 1, 2, and 3 each have 3 cells in block 1 (columns 1, 2, and 3), 3 cells in block 2 (columns 4, 5, and 6), and 3 cells in block 3 (columns 7, 8, and 9).</p><p>The before and after screenshots below show this applied to rows:</p><span class="img-container"> <!-- Inline parent element --><img src="images/alg3Before.png" width="417" height="556"></span><p>Notice on row 2 cells 8 and 9 have had the value '1' removed.  The value '1' has been removed from the 3rd sector.  This is because the algorthim noticed that the value '1' must reside somewhere on row 3's 3rd sector.  Therefore the solution '1' cannot be on the 3rd sector for rows 1 and 2.</p><p>In row 5 the value '5' has been removed from the 1st sector.  This is because on row 4 there is no '5' in it's 2nd or 3rd sector.  Therefore the solution '5' must lie on sector 1 for row 4 which means that it cannot reside in sector 1 for rows 5 and 6.</p><span class="img-container"> <!-- Inline parent element --><img src="images/alg3After.png" width="417" height="556"></span><a href="./index.htm">Main Page</a></body></html>
