Withoout any knowledge of adjacent cells the possible solutions for the 'Unsolved' cells are {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} otherwise known as 'the full set'.  By 'pruning' however, many degrees of freedom can be eliminated.  For any given cell, pruning can be applied to the Row, Column, and Block that the cell is located in.  Pruning should be applied to all cells for all 3 modes (Rows, Columns, and Blocks) after initial puzzle import.  Aso, after every 'Solve' operation the data set is pruned post Solve operation.  Specifically, any time any cell becomes 'Solved', the data set should be pruned.</p><p>The unsolved node count is calculated by counting all the numbers in all the cells then subtracting 81 as there will be 0 unsolved nodes when there is only 1 number in each cell.  When the unsolved node count reaches 0 the puzzle is solved and the Solve button is disabled as no more solving can take place.</p><p>The puzzle is solved by repeated application of the three algorithms available through the Algorithm Selection bar just under the puzzle cell array.  The following pages describe in detail how the algorithms work:</p><h2>Credits</h2><p>Written by Matthew Homer<br>HomerLabs<br>San Jose, CA<br>Last Modified: 5/19/2020</p><p>Special thanks to "www.websudoku.com"<a href="./index.htm">Main Page</a></body></html>
