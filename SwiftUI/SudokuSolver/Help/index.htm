When the unsolved node count reaches 0 the puzzle is solved and the Solve button is disabled as no more solving can take place.</p><p>The puzzle is solved by repeated application of the three algorithms available through the Algorithm Selection bar just under the puzzle cell array.  The following pages describe in detail how the algorithms work:</p><a href="alg1.htm">Algorithm 1:  Mono Cell</a><br><a href="alg2.htm">Algorithm 2:  Find Sets</a><br><a href="alg3.htm">Algorithm 3:  Mono Sector</a><br><h2>Special Features Available from the Menu</h2><p>New (Command-N)   Not really a special feature but wanted to include it in the menu descriptions.  Works the same as hitting the 'New Puzzle' button.</p><p>Fetch (Shift-Command-N)   This will request the puzzle id from the User and then fetch it.  This was the original purpose of the app.  To help me solve really hard puzzles that I was stuck on.</p><p>Save (Command-S)   At anytime, a snapshot of the puzzle can be saved to a '.txt' file.     <a href="file_format.htm">Puzzle Data Format Description</a></p><p>Open (Command-O)   A new puzzle can be loaded from a properly formatted text file.  Typically this file would be created by a 'Save' operation but it could also be hand crafted.</p><p>Written by Matthew Homer<br>HomerLabs<br>San Jose, CA<br>Last Modified: 1/9/2019</p></body></html>
