#  Prime Finder

Prime Finder finds all primes up to a terminal prime value.  It creates a rather larger ".txt" file from which the "Find Nice Primes" function scans and produces a second file of primes where (p-1)/2 is also prime.  The "nice primes" are good candidates to seed P and Q primes in my RSA Encrypter app.
